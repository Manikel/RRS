# Privacy Policy for Roblox Region Selector

_Last updated: October 2025_

Your privacy is important. This extension (“Roblox Region Selector”) is designed with privacy by default. Below we explain what data is collected, how it is used, and your rights.

---

## Information We Collect
- **Server Data**: The extension requests Roblox server lists and region information from Roblox’s public APIs.
- **Latency Tests**: To display estimated ping, the extension sends lightweight requests to Cloudflare test endpoints. These requests are anonymous and contain no personal information.
- **Local Cache**: Recently scanned server data may be cached **locally on your browser** for up to 60 seconds to improve performance.

We do **not** collect, store, or transmit:
- Personal identifiers
- Account credentials
- Browsing history
- Payment information

---

## How We Use Data
- To show available Roblox servers and their regions
- To estimate network latency between your device and different regions
- To make the extension faster through short-term local caching

All processing is done locally in your browser.

---

## Sharing of Data
- We do **not** share or sell any data.
- No data is transmitted to the developer or third parties beyond Roblox’s and Cloudflare’s public endpoints (which are required for functionality).

---

## Permissions
The extension requests the following permissions only to function:
- `*://*.roblox.com/*` for server APIs  
- `*://*.cloudflare.com/*` and `*://*.speed.cloudflare.com/*` for latency testing  
- `storage` to keep a short cache of scan results  

---

## Your Choices
- You can remove the extension at any time via your browser’s extensions page.
- Clearing browser storage removes all cached data.
